Cookie Sheet Sprite Generator
============

Cookie Sheet is a sprite generator script for Photoshop written in Javascript

When making or processing animations in Photoshop it is common to overlay multiple layers on top of one-another and show/hide them as keyframes.
This is also how Photoshop opens a standard .gif file.

This script takes a multilayer file and turns it into a grid-perfect sprite sheet with each layer separated out, but still centered relative to the original canvas dimensions
